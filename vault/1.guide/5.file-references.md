Pi Island provides file reference autocompletion to easily include files in your prompts.

## Using File References

1. Type `@` to start a file reference
2. A dropdown appears with files from the session's working directory
3. Use **arrow keys** to navigate
4. Press **Tab** or **Enter** to select
5. Press **Escape** to dismiss

## Navigating Directories

File completion supports nested paths:

- Type `@` to see root directory contents
- Select a directory (shown with folder icon) to enter it
- Type `@src/` to list contents of the `src` directory
- Continue navigating deeper as needed

Directories are shown first (with yellow folder icons), followed by files.

## Hidden Files

Hidden files (starting with `.`) are only shown when you type a dot:

- `@` shows regular files only
- `@.` shows hidden files like `.gitignore`, `.env`

## File Type Icons

Files are displayed with type-specific icons:

| Extension | Icon |
|-----------|------|
| `.swift` | Swift logo |
| `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` | Document |
| `.json` | Curly braces |
| `.md`, `.markdown` | Rich text |
| `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif` | Photo |
| `.yml`, `.yaml` | List |
| Other | Generic document |

## How It Works

When you submit a message containing `@path/to/file`:

1. Pi resolves the path relative to the working directory
2. The file contents are read and included in the context
3. For images, they are sent as attachments

This allows you to easily reference code, configurations, screenshots, or any file relevant to your conversation.
